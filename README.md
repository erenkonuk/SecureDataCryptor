 This project is a Java application that demonstrates secure data encryption and decryption using the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA). It allows users to encrypt and decrypt data, save and load encrypted data to/from files, and manage user roles and passwords securely. The project uses SQLite for user and role management.
